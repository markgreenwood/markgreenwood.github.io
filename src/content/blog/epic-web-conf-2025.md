# Motivation
Several months ago I started seriously considering attending Epic Web Conf 2025 in Salt Lake City. I knew Kent C. Dodds was a motivating force behind this conference, and in the past year I had completed his Epic React and Epic Web Dev courses. Those courses were rich in good material, and provided exercises that really promote learning and retention. If his courses were that good, I figured the conference would meet a similarly high standard.

What did I want to get out of attending this conference?
- I hadn't attended an in-person conference since before the pandemic, and I was really missing the opportunity to meet technical folks outside my day-to-day job, learn from them, and compare notes on our experiences working with similar tech.
- I wanted to learn more about what people were doing with the Remix / React Router framework since my team had developed two new products with it in the past year, and we're still discovering the best practices for doing so.
- Finally, I wanted to take my son (a recent grad in computer science) to the conference with me and help him start developing professional relationships and engaging with the larger tech community.
# Arrival
Arriving the night before, we got off to a great start. I reviewed the messages in the Discord channel for the conference and noticed that a few folks were posting about meeting up for dinner that night. I asked my son "what do you think about meeting up with some people we don't know and going to dinner?" He was game, so we headed down to the lobby. I expected these were people who knew each other prior to the conference and we'd just be tagging along, but I discovered these were just people randomly reaching out to meet up. We ended up at dinner in a party of 10, had great conversation, and made a bunch of new friends before the events even officially started. And that was to set the tone for the rest of the conference...
# Workshop
On Tuesday, Tyler and I attended the React Server Components workshop led by Kent. We did a pretty deep dive into how RSCs work, using a very basic scaffold app with plain JS and no build tools. I really liked this approach because it provides the chance to see what happens "under the hood" and demystify some of the things that are usually hidden behind abstractions.

The workshop was presented in the same format as Kent's Epic React and Epic Web Dev courses, with video explanations, a sophisticated workshop dev environment, and scaffolding for the exercises that still leaves plenty of room for doing the substantive implementation that we're there to learn about. The difference in doing the live workshop is that Kent elaborates more on the concepts than in the online courses, and is there to interact with us and answer questions. This extra value was well worth the cost of the workshop.
# Pre-conference Party
Tuesday night, we attended the pre-conference party sponsored by Mux at a local brewpub. I'm happy to say this had the same great vibe as dinner the night before. Everyone was very friendly and open to socializing, and eager to make introductions and connections. I later realized that, at least in part, this atmosphere is fostered by Kent and the other organizers - they consider making personal connections and engaging in good "hallway conversations" one of the biggest benefits of an in-person conference.
# Speakers
On Wednesday, we attended the conference's single track. I really appreciated this format because when I've attended conferences with multiple tracks, I often find time slots with no talks I'm interested in, and then other slots where I have to choose between two talks I really want to see.

With the single track, I was able to see all the talks I wanted to. And frankly with the quality of the presentations, I was interested in seeing most of them! Most presentations were 20 min long, with a few 5 min lightning talks thrown in. Kudos to the organizers and all the presenters, who were well-prepared and did an awesome job being organized and sticking to the schedule.

All were good but there were a few standouts:
- Aaron Francis' talk
- Annie Sexton's history of JavaScript
- Shruti Kapoor's talk on accessibility
- Eva Ferriera's talk on design systems
- Alex Anderson's talk on weird web interfaces (many applications to IoT)
# Summary
For me, the conference was a huge success in all respects. I met a bunch of new folks who are working with similar tech, and we got to compare notes on our experiences, share lessons learned, and talk about directions things are heading. I leveled up my knowledge of parts of the frameworks I hadn't used before. And finally, I was able to provide my son a great, positive introductory experience to the tech community he'll be working with in future.

As I mentioned before, this success is largely due to the care Kent and his colleagues bring to creating and curating this conference experience. By emphasizing the personal connections aspect and providing plenty of social opportunities amidst the talks and workshops, they provide substantial value that's unique to an in-person gathering. It was well worth the cost, and I will likely attend this conference again in the future.
