## Mark Greenwood - Software Engineer

**Greetings!** I'm Mark Greenwood, a software engineer living in Portland, OR, US.

I specialize in front-end and back-end development, utilizing the latest technologies to build responsive and user-friendly websites. My proficiency includes:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Postgres
- Microservices
- GraphQL
- Terraform

Originally, my academic background is electrical engineering, and I spent many years working in chip design and semiconductor manufacturing. So I have a solid understanding of hardware, and how software interacts with it and thereby controls objects in the physical world.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming ideas into functional, elegant websites. Whether it's optimizing performance, implementing new features, or troubleshooting issues, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

Living in Estonia has not only influenced my appreciation for nature and culture but has also shaped my approach to web development. I understand the importance of creating digital solutions that resonate with local audiences while maintaining a global perspective.

## Continuous Learning

The dynamic nature of the tech industry inspires me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace emerging technologies that enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the websites I create.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with clients, designers, or fellow developers, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.

## Hobbies and Activities
When I'm not creating awesome software, I might be...
- running, weightlifting, or cycling
- playing the electric guitar or bass
- cooking
- enjoying a glass of wine or a great cup of coffee
