## Mark Greenwood - Software Engineer

**Greetings!** I'm Mark Greenwood, a software engineer living in Portland, OR, US.

![Alt text for image](/Mark_wearing_vest.jpg)

## Skills and Expertise

My original academic background is electrical engineering, and I spent many years 
working in chip design and semiconductor manufacturing. My specialty was radio frequency and 
microwave communication, and I produced chips that connect the world's most popular
mobile devices to the cellular network. I have extensive experience using software 
to interact with hardware, thereby manipulating objects in the physical world through programming.

In 2016 I decided to "career pivot" into focusing completely on software development, driven by the
love of programming I'd had since I was young. To enhance my software background I attended a code school
to gain immersive experience in designing web apps. Since then I've focused on developing data-intensive applications
that help our clients pursue energy efficiency and sustainability goals, saving them money and reducing their carbon footprint.

## Hobbies and Activities
When I'm not creating awesome software, I might be...
- running 🏃‍♂️, weightlifting 🏋️‍♀️, or cycling 🚴
- playing the electric guitar or bass 🎸
- cooking
- enjoying a glass of wine 🍷or a great cup of coffee ☕️
