## Mark Greenwood - Software Engineer

**Greetings!** I'm Mark Greenwood, a software engineer living in Portland, OR, US.

![Alt text for image](/Mark_wearing_vest.jpg)

## Skills and Expertise

My original academic background is electrical engineering, and I spent many years 
working in chip design and semiconductor manufacturing. My specialty was radio frequency and 
microwave communication, and I produced chips enabling the world's most popular
mobile devices to communicate with the cell network. I have solid experience getting 
hardware and software to interact, thereby controlling objects in the physical world through programming.

In 2016 I decided to "career pivot" into focusing completely on software development, driven by the consistent
love of programming I'd had since I was young. To add new skills to my software background I attended a code school
to gain immersive experience in designing web applications. Since then I've focused on developing applications that
support energy efficiency and sustainability, helping clients both save money and reduce their carbon footprint.

## Hobbies and Activities
When I'm not creating awesome software, I might be...
- running, weightlifting, or cycling
- playing the electric guitar or bass
- cooking
- enjoying a glass of wine or a great cup of coffee

## Get in Touch

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out for collaboration, consultation, or just a friendly chat about all things web development.
